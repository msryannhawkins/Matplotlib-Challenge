# Matplotlib-Challenge
In this challenge, I was given access to the complete data from a recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

I was tasked with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. I was also expected to provide a top-level summary of the study results.

This challeneg was broken down into the following tasks:
    Prepare the data.

    Generate summary statistics.

    Create bar charts and pie charts.

    Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.

    Create a line plot and a scatter plot.

    Calculate correlation and regression.

    Submit the final analysis.
